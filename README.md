# MusiKumiLove

## **Instructions**
To create a program that reads a music sheet in PDF format, plays the music aloud, and optionally adds correct fingering for an instrument like the oboe, Python is an excellent choice. Here's why and how you can approach this project:

## **Why Python?**
1. **Rich Libraries and Frameworks**: Python has robust libraries for Optical Music Recognition (OMR), audio processing, and PDF handling, making it ideal for this task.
   - Libraries like OpenCV and PyPDF2 can handle image/PDF processing.
   - MIDIUtil or music21 can generate MIDI files for playback.
   - Text-to-speech libraries like pyttsx3 can provide audio output.
2. **Community Support**: Python's vast community ensures plenty of resources and examples to guide you in implementing complex tasks like OMR or fingering generation.
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Python works seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## **Steps to Build Your Program**

### **1. Optical Music Recognition (OMR)**
To read music sheets from PDFs:
- Use an OMR library such as [cadenCV](https://github.com/afikanyati/cadenCV) or [Mozart](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/kwhsaa/mozart_an_optical_music_recognition_system/). These tools convert sheet music images into machine-readable formats like MusicXML or MIDI[1][7].
- If your PDF contains scanned images, preprocess the images using OpenCV to enhance recognition accuracy.

### **2. Playing the Music**
Once the sheet music is converted to MIDI:
- Use Python's `pygame.midi` or external tools like MuseScore to play the MIDI file[2][7].
- Alternatively, libraries like `music21` allow you to manipulate and play back MIDI files.

### **3. Adding Fingering for Oboe**
For fingering annotations:
- Use existing oboe fingering charts as a reference (e.g., The Woodwind Fingering Guide)[5][20].
- Implement logic to match notes in the sheet music with appropriate fingerings based on pitch and context. This could involve:
  - A lookup table for basic fingerings.
  - Dynamic algorithms that consider transitions between notes for ergonomic playing (similar to piano fingering algorithms)[4][19].
- You might also integrate LilyPond, which supports fingering annotations in its notation syntax[9].

### **4. User Interface**
Build a user-friendly interface where users can:
- Upload PDF files.
- View the recognized sheet music and its playback.
- See annotated fingerings for oboe notes.

For a GUI, Python's `tkinter` or `PyQt` can be used.

## **Additional Tools and Libraries**
1. **LilyPond**: For engraving high-quality sheet music with fingering annotations[9][10].
2. **MuseScore**: For converting PDFs to editable scores and exporting them as MIDI files[15].
3. **PDFtoMusic Pro**: A specialized tool for extracting music-related elements from PDFs into formats like MusicXML or MIDI[17].

## **Challenges**
1. OMR accuracy depends heavily on the quality of the input PDF (e.g., clear scans vs. handwritten scores).
2. Generating ergonomic fingerings dynamically requires careful algorithm design and testing with real musicians.

Python's versatility makes it ideal for this multi-faceted project, combining OMR, audio playback, and fingering annotation into a cohesive tool.
